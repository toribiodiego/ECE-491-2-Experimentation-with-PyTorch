> This repository contains the code for **ECE 491: Experimentation with PyTorch**, a graduate-level, 3-credit course offering hands-on deep learning experience with PyTorch. Under **Professor Carl Sable**'s guidance, it includes exercises from *Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn* by Raschka, Liu, and Mirjalili, the Hugging Face NLP Tutorial, and our final project work. The course is designed to deepen our PyTorch proficiency and inspire innovative final projects that transcend conventional deep learning approaches.



## Course Overview

In *Experimentation with PyTorch*, students gain practical experience with the PyTorch framework through weekly discussions, readings, and hands-on tutorials. The course covers a wide range of topics that deepen understanding of PyTorch, including the use of pre-built and pretrained models from the Hugging Face Hub as well as the development of custom layers, loss functions, and architectures. 

 While the primary focus is on NLP, the curriculum also touches on other machine learning domains such as computer vision, audio, and video processing. Ultimately, the course is designed to build proficiency in PyTorch and guide students toward conceptualizing and implementing a final project that transcends conventional deep learning approaches.
